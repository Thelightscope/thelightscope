# LightScope

Smart attackers scan with one IP, strike with another—and evade honeypots.  
**LightScope** exposes the real threat by linking scans to attacks on live production systems.

---

## How It Works

**Deceive. Discover. Defend.**

- **Deceive**  
  Feed tailored misinformation to different scanners—show one attacker an open port, hide it from another.

- **Discover**  
  Track who takes the bait to uncover relationships between scanning and attacking IPs.

- **Defend**  
  Block the real attacker infrastructure, not just the disposable scanning IPs.





# Academic Description
LightScope is a cybersecurity research project that examines unwanted traffic from attackers and scanners on the internet. LightScope is different from existing solutions as it turns closed ports on live machines into an network telescopes and can forward attacker traffic to a USC managed honeypot. It deliberately feeds false information to some scanners and not others in order to map the relationships between who knew something was open and who later showed up to attack it. The LightScope client is free, open source, extremely lightweight, and designed to run on production machines. If you install it you will be provided with rich information about who’s targeting your network and tailored IP blocklists you can use to keep your network safe. 

LightScope is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2313998 and the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute.
